    <p>The rib eye or ribeye (known as Scotch fillet in Australia and New Zealand) is a boneless rib steak from the rib section. It is both flavoursome and tender, coming from the lightly worked upper rib cage area which spans from the sixth to twelfth ribs of the cattle. Its marbling of fat makes it very good for fast and hot cooking.</p>
    <p>There are several ways to cook a ribeye:
      <ul>
        <li>Grilled: Grilling will give you the most natural taste since it's cooked with fire and has the most heat exposure. It also gives you the most control over the temperature.</li>
        <li>Stovetop on a cast iron skillet: Stovetop is the least messy and is the more general method. Using a cast iron skillet allows for great heat distribution and flash cooking the steak to give it a <u>beautiful</u> sear</li>
        <li>Stovetop (no cast iron skillet): The same as above but with no cast iron skillet. The only difference here is not using a cast iron does not provide as much room for temperature regulating, but if you know how to cook a steak, it should be negligable.</li>
        <li>Pan roasted/Baking: Baking and pan roasting are the least popular (for good reason), but are the most convinient and hands-off solutions.</li>
    </ul>

    <li>Cook for 3 minutes or until tender</li>
