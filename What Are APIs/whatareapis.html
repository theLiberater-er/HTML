<h3>Essential Information</h3>
<ul>
	<li>This site is being used as practice HTML/CSS and to document what APIs are for my understanding.</li>
	<li>I am using <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXsD0ZgxjRw">this video from freecodeCamp's YouTube channel</a> as the source material for this site</li>
</ul>	
<h3>What are APIs?</h3>
<section class="whatareapis">
<article class="whatareapis1">
<p>API stands for Application Programming Interface:</p> 
<ul>
	<li>A - Application</li>
		<ul>
			<li> </li>
		</ul>
	<li>P - Programming</li>
		<ul>
			<li> </li>
		</ul>
	<li>I - Interface</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Providing the developer a means of controlling their interactions while hiding away all the complex and abstract stuff. We don't need to know <i>how</i> an API works, and the interface hides all of the complex and abstrct code from us (developers) so we don't "reinvent the wheel".</li> 
			<li>As a developer, we need to know what the API can do for us and how we can integrate it into our project.</li>
			<li>The interface defines ways for users to interact or communicate with an object (a GUI is a good example).</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
<p>APIs are essentially a set of instructions on how to interact with specific sites/apps/services. APIs are like a contract where they define how they will be used and defines what is expected to be received when being used. APIs are mostly 
web-based, but there are ones that are local.</p>
<p>Frameworks are API(s) that provide major customization and scalability to make it your own</p>
<p>Remote APIs are very good for the purpose of removing the limitation of computational power of a smartphone (for example).</p>

<article class="apiexamples">
<p>We use APIs every day to interact with a lot of different sources to obtain data. For example, the weather app on the iPhone uses an API to pull data from the Google weather services to leverage in their app.
Another example of an API is the Spotify app on your phone using an API to pull the song you want to listen to from their servers and stream it to your device. A third, and probably very common, example is YouTube. 
They use APIs to load the videos in the web browser and stream the videos from their servers.</p>

<article class="restvssoap">
<p>There are two types of major APIs: REST (often called RESTful) and SOAP. SOAP came before REST and was invented by Microsoft. There are benefits to both, but REST is used to develop over 70% of public APIs. 
Powerhouse companies like Google and Amazon use REST APIs in their technologies.<br>Here are the benefits to both SOAP and REST:</p>
<ul>
	<li>REST (Representational State Transfer)</li>
		<ul>
			<li>REST allows for a variety of data formats while SOAP only allows XML.</li>
			<li>REST uses lower bandwidth, making these APIs faster when connecticting to remote servers/services/etc.</li>
			<li>REST is designed to access data while SOAP is designed to perform operations through a standardized set of messaging patters.</li>
			<li>REST is considered easy to work with, and thanks to JSON, REST offers superior support for browser clients.</li>
		</ul>
	<li>SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)</li>
		<ul>
			<li>SOAP's standard HTTP protocol makes it easier for it to operate across firewalls and proxys.</li>
			<li>SOAP supports WS-Security, which is invauluable when in need of data privacy and integrity.</li>
			<li>SOAP has builti-in retry logic that prevents the user from manually retrying the API call the first time it fails.</li>
			<li>SOAP has a standard set of rules, which means that the service and consumer don't necesarily have to have the same understanding of content and context.</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
